# SketchAnalysis
SketchAnalysis is a web application hosted on www.vitoferrulli.it/sketchanalysis  that analyzes the attributes of the 3D models available on sketchfab.com and shows related graphs.The main attributes of the models taken into consideration for this project are:
- Number of Views
- Number of Like
- Number of Comments
- Number of Vertices of the model
- Number of Faces of the model

### Dataset
The dataset used for the study was obtained through the use of [jSketchfabCrawler](https://github.com/ferru97/jSketchfabCrawler), a java application developed by Ferrulli Vito used to crawl the model's information from sketchfab.com using its public API.
The crawling process was carried out for 4 days, from 13/03/2020 to 16/03/2020, by downloading the data relating to the models in descending order of views, from 16 million views to 175. In this period we collected information relating to 220K models.
The dataset is available [HERE](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Bg0y6PvZTIPkIJ-87KfdUy-BHpBfTdui)



Thanks to [sketchfab.com](https://sketchfab.com/) for the kind concession of the data
